Windows:

Use MinGW.

1. Install TakeoffGW:

  Random Notes (Don't actually bother reading):

        TakeoffGW is a new project to provide a manageable
    installation of MinGW/MSYS. The installers mingw has are really
    old, and don't really work. The site is confusing, and is mostly a
    collection of old documentation which doesn't work, and some of it
    tells you that. Their recommended "installation" process is to
    individually download and extract pieces you need from
    Sourceforge. It's a hopeless cause.

        I spent several days battling to try to do this. Various
    sources had scripts to try to get a basic install started. None of
    them worked for various reasons. In particular, around when I
    started working on getting this working, they decided to start
    moving files around, breaking the links in everyone's scripts. I
    fought for a while to fix them, and to generate a new one. I
    discovered more and more layers of brokenness, and after wasting
    several days fighting, I got about 95% of the way to a functioning
    installation before I discovered TakeoffGW.

        It's mostly a rebranded Cygwin installer with packages build
    with MinGW/MSYS. The fundamental difference between MinGW/MSYS and
    Cygwin is that Cygwin provides glibc on Windows, and links against
    that. MinGW uses the Microsoft C library. The BOINC people say to
    use it over Cygwin. Cygwin should work however for building it. I
    have only sort of tried that.  There is a MinGW "cross compiler"
    in Cygwin (using the msvcrt library), and should be the same but I
    also have not actually tried this, so these instructions are for
    what I actually got working.

Actual instructions:

1.1 Start by downloading the TakeoffGW installer from http://sourceforge.net/projects/takeoffgw/

1.2 Run the installer.

        It may recommend installing to a subdirectory of a Cygwin
    install if you have one. This may work, but I didn't do it so I
    suggest not doing that. Ideally this would be C:\takeoffgw, since
    that's what I ended up with, and I think is the default. I don't
    actually remember much of what happened here. My will to live had
    already been taken.

1.3 Select the necessary packages. I think this is the complete set of
things you will need. Be careful, there are several similar sounding
packages. In particular the multiple gcc and binutils packages.

    Base group:
	  msys-findutils
	  msys-grep
      msys-man
      msys-gzip
      msys-sed
      msys-tar

   Libs group:
      binutils (make sure it says version 2.20)
      binutils-devel

    devel group:
	  gcc (make sure all gcc packages are >= 4.4, otherwise you've found the wrong gcc)
      gcc-c++
      gcc-c++-dll
      gcc-dll
      popt
      popt-devel
      git-mingw

    MingGW Group:
	  autoconf
      automake

    MSYS Group:
	  msys-bash
      msys-core
      msys-core-devel
      msys-make
      msys-openssh
      msys-w32api
      msys-vim

    Text:
      msys-less

    Utils group:
      msys-patch
      msys-diffutils

1.4 If it asks to install unmet dependencies or anything, agree to
    whatever it wants.

2. Configure TakeoffGW

  2.1 Start the TakeoffGW shell.

  2.2 It is necessary to configure the path to use the right gcc,
  libraries and tools. Go to the root of your takeoffgw installation
  (should be C:\takeoffgw, or from within the takeoffgw shell /).

  2.3. Edit /etc/profile

    Somewhere near the bottom add the line:

    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/mingw/bin:/i686-pc-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin:/bin:$PATH

    Alternatively if for some reason that doesn't work, you can do what I did and
    should always work.

    Create a file somewhere within the takeoffgw
    installation (e.g. /home/username/.bashrc) and then every time you
    start the shell, run

    $ source /home/username/.bashrc

    Why you need to source your bashrc here I don't understand. Your
    home directory seems to have changed from /home/username to your
    actual Windows user directory the second time I installed it, so
    I'm not sure what will happen now.

  2.4 Caution: When trying to fix whatever caused any of this to not
  work, note the following really stupid behaviour of MinGW:

    /usr is the same as /. It's incredibly stupid and doesn't make sense
    at all. e.g. if you try creating /usr/local/lib/libboinc, this will
    be C:\takeoffgw\local\lib\libboinc. Note this when setting paths
    and such.

3. Install the BOINC libraries

  3.1 If you installed subversion/svn from the TakeoffGW installer, you
      should be able check it out with

       $ svn co http://boinc.berkeley.edu/svn/trunk/boinc

        Get it checked out somehow, and somewhere in your takeoffgw root,
         preferably /home/username/whatever

  3.2 Patch BOINC

      To get the BOINC libraries to compile, you right now need a
      patch that I wrote. Get it somehow, and apply it

      $ patch -p1 < /path/to/the.patch
      (if this fails, try replacing -p1 with -p0. I never get it right)


  3.3 Compile the BOINC libraries

      Go to the lib subdirectory of the your boinc source checkout.

      $ cd boinc/lib

      Compile them.

      $ make -f Makefile.mingw

      Assuming there were no errors, install them

      $ make -f Makefile.mingw install

      Now you should have the BOINC libraries installed.

4. Compile the milkyway client

  4.1 If you installed git from

    Checking out from the read-only URL:

    $ git clone git://github.com/arsenm/milkywayathome_client.git

    Or if you have your SSH and github tokens etc. set up,

    $ git clone git@github.com:arsenm/milkywayathome_client.git

  4.2 Use cmake to generate makefiles

      Navigate to the git checkout, and run

      $ cmake . -G "MSYS Makefiles"

  4.3 Compile

     $ make

  Note if you need to change the compiler, and some other settings in
  cmake, you must delete CMakeCache.txt.

  4.4 The client should now be build with an exe in bin/ and a
      library in lib/


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Linux:

1. Install dependencies

   Ubuntu / Debian:

    (Note: apt-get build-dep boinc-app-milkyway for Debian. I'm not sure it's actually helpful anyway)

    # Make sure the necessary build tools are installed
    $ apt-get build-essential
    $ apt-get install libpopt-dev cmake autoconf automake libtool git-core subversion diffutils patch
    $ apt-get build-dep boinc-app-milkyway boinc-client boinc-manager boinc-dev

  Other Distributions: Install equivalent packages.

  Arch: Most/all? dependencies can be installed by installing the
        boinc package.

     $ pacman -S boinc

2. Checkout BOINC

 $ svn co http://boinc.berkeley.edu/svn/trunk/boinc

3. Build BOINC

  I had a little bit trouble getting this to build, but it's easiest
  to only compile the libraries which are all we need.

  3.1 Run their silly wrapper script around autools which shouldn't
  exist:

    cd to the boinc checkout

    $ ./_autosetup

    If this fails complaining about a missing libtoolize, edit
    _autosetup and remove/comment out the block checking for
    libtoolize.

  3.2 Run standard autoconf stuff, enabling only the libraries. The
      enabling debugging is optional, but for this purpose recommended.

    $ ./configure --disable-client --disable-server --enable-debug
    $ make
    $ sudo make install


4. Compile the milkyway client
 4.1 Check it out

   $ git clone git://github.com/arsenm/milkywayathome_client.git

   Or if you have your SSH and github tokens etc. set up,

   $ git clone git@github.com:arsenm/milkywayathome_client.git

  4.2 Use cmake to generate makefiles

      Navigate to the git checkout, and run

      $ cmake .

  4.3 Compile

     $ make

  Note if you need to change the compiler, and some other settings in
  cmake, you must delete CMakeCache.txt.

  4.4 The client should now be build with an executable in bin/ and a
      library in lib/

Note: If you do try to build the client, and you have a recent
GNOME/Gtk/Glib/GIO install, you need the latest development version of
wxWidgets installed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OS X:

1. Install Xcode and the Apple developer tools. This may involve
joining some sort of cult.

2. Install macports

3. Install dependencies by running:

  $ port install cmake popt git-core autoconf automake

4. Continue from step 3 of the Linux instructions. Note that the Apple
   gcc is required. If you have a macports gcc installed in your path
   before it, you will need to specify it manually on the cmake step
   with one of

     $ cmake . -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER

     or

     $ CC=/usr/bin/gcc cmake .

    If you get this wrong originally, you will need to rm CMakeCache.txt



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nbody code:

You must install the json-c library and headers.

Ubuntu: in apt as "libjson0" and "libjson0-dev"
Fedora: in yum as json-c
OS X: in macports as "json-c"
Arch Linux: in the aur as "json-c"

If it's not already packaged for your platform, you can downlaod and
build it yourself from

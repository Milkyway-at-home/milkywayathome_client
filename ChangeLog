separation 1.0:
	- CAL version removed.
	- Added IL injection for AMD GPUs (Only R770, Cypress, Cayman)
	- AVX detection, and --force-avx argument
	- Added --force-no-opencl argument
	- Added --force-no-il-kernel argument
	- Project preferences work for GPU target frequency
	- Increase default target frequency to 60
	- Kernel source is now always inlined
	- Fix Kahan summation on CPU
	- Add Kahan summation GPU
	- Use GPU for summarization of GPU results
	- Use BOINC app_init_data OpenCL device index if available
	- Workaround for high CPU usage with recent Nvidia drivers
	- Redid chunking yet again


nbody 0.80:
	- Added OpenCL version
	- Add progress reporting if Ncurses is available
	- "Exact" criterion is now an actual exact implementation. To get
	       the old "Exact" behaviour, use theta = 0.0 with the BH86 criterion

	- Histogram no longer needed to generate histogram
	- Histogram is now CSV
	- Histogram now have comments (#) and ignores blank lines
	- Histogram now includes lambda
	- Fix possibility of checkpoints breaking for simulations running the same directory
	- Fix not using SSE2 intrinsics in dSFMT
	- Can now return a Lua function from makePotential() as external potential.
	     Must take 3 numbers as x, y, z and return acceleration as a_x, a_y, a_z

	- Add --static-draw option to display body output file to visualizer
	- Slightly reduced memory usage of cells
	- Fixed annoying creation of empty output files at beginning
	- Last checkpoint is now deleted by default on completion
	- Added 'make bench' simple benchmark
	- Setting NBODY_FLAGS environment variable will pass extra flags to tests/benchmark
	- Add more user documentation using texinfo.
	- Add --match-histogram argument
	- Add new likelihood options


separation 0.80:
	- GPU checkpointing for CAL and OpenCL builds
	- New arguments to disable GPU checkpointing: --gpu-disable-checkpointing
	- SSE2 intrinsics
	- Different SSE levels all in one binary
	- New optional Lua parameters file
	- Better chunking for CAL and OpenCL builds
	- Better automated tests
	- Argument --responsiveness-factor removed
	- Argument --non-responsive added (use with caution)
	- Arguments for controlling which path is used (--force-x87, --force-sse2, --force-sse3, --force-no-intrinsics)


nbody 0.40:
	- Replace JSON config file with Lua
	- Support for arbitrary initial distributions with Lua
	- Bindings to old utility functions for Plummer sphere, timestep calculation, eps2 etc.
	- Simulation can now be run with no background potential
	- Fix "No error" message for some checkpointing failures on Windows
	- Improved partial automated testing (mostly incomplete)
	- Add option to silence tree structure errors
	- No longer immediately aborts on tree structure errors
	- Add argument to prevent BOINC from eating stderr
	- Fix conflicts with Apple headers when using Macports GCC
	- Checkpointing no longer requires initial config file (likely to change again)
	- Checkpointing now works without BOINC
